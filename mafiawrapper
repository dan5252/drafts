Problem: MafiaTool uses GSM network to push SMSes. GSM network is slow.. boring players for waiting.
Everyone has a phone. GSM even when not 3G or more.

Requirements:
  Fast
  Almost everywhere
  Reuse code
  No need for external connectvity. (A fried port router which still wireless routes is good)
  Keep it onto 1 device.
  Security between players so they can't access others
  With no registration needed
  No need for fancy GUI
  Make GMs life easier as much as possible
    Store setup to quickly adjust game
    Drag and drop to switch places as in MafiaTool???

Solution:
  Separate MafiaTool into MafiaEngine and a wrapper over it that pushes information fast.
  Everyone has a browser.
  Use web server as REST API controller for MafiaEngine.
    When running the server the IP is displayed. Inject a domain fo that IP into LAN??
  Use routes to REST interact because no fancy GUI.

 Flow:
  GM sets up the game once.
    gameplay settings
    player names
    roles
  Store setup in cookies
    
Game loop:
    Players do night votes through web browser. Day updates are displayed.
    Players do votes. GM kicks the voted out(may be multiple). GM progresses game to night.
    Upon transitions between day/night cycles win state is checked.
