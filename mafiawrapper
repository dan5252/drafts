Problem: MafiaTool uses GSM network to push SMSes. GSM network is slow.. boring players for waiting.
Everyone has a phone. GSM even when not 3G or more.

Requirements:
  Fast
  Almost everywhere
  Reuse code
  No need for external connectvity. (A broken router which routes is good)
  Keep it onto 1 device.
  Security between players so they can't access others
  With no registration needed
  No need for fancy GUI
  Make GMs life easier as much as possible

Solution:
  Separate MafiaTool into MafiaEngine and a wrapper over it that pushes information fast.
  Use web server as REST API controller for MafiaEngine. Run web server on smartphone.
  Everyone has a browser.

Flow:
  GM sets up the game once.
    gameplay settings
    player names
    roles
    
  Game loop:
    Players do night votes through web browser. Day updates are displayed.
    Players do votes. GM kicks the voted out(may be multiple). GM progresses game to night.
    Upon transitions between day/night cycles win state is checked.
